            <p>
                Backyard poultry production is at the subsistence level of farming. Birds live free range and hatch their own eggs. Their diet is supplemented with crop waste or food leftovers. The labour involved in backyard poultry production is part-time.
                Farm flock production is slightly more specialized. Eggs are hatched at a separate location where the hatch and the sexing of the birds are controlled.
                Commercial poultry farm production involves full-time labour and is geared toward producing on a sufficient scale for the sale of both eggs and poultry meat.
                Specialized egg production consists of separating poultry for meat and egg production. In the egg producing plant, specialized employees oversee specific aspects of egg production.
                Integrated egg production is the most advanced enterprise and involves full mechanization and automation of the egg production cycle including battery egg laying, temperature controls, scientific feeding and mechanized egg collection methods.

            <h1 class="display-4">Increase Feed</h1>
            <p>Commercial feeds from a reliable feed store have all the nutrients in the right proportions that the chickens need. 
                A balanced diet is necessary for optimal growth and production. 
                If you use a good diet that meets the dietary needs of your flocks, supplementing with other items with upset the balance of the diet. 
                The ingredients used in different types of feeds are similar, but the proportions vary depending on the particular chickens being fed. 
                Each bag of feed is labeled with its specific use.
        
                Common mistakes made with supplements include the following:
                
                Providing vitamin and electrolyte supplements for more than 10 days
                Supplementing complete feeds with cracked corn, oats, or other grains
                Regularly adding green chops, lettuce, or other low nutrition ingredients to the diet
                Administering inappropriate or unnecessary medication
                A chickenâ€™s daily consumption of feed depends on the composition of the diet.
                Chickens typically adjust their feed intake in order to meet their energy requirements. 
                As the energy content of a diet increases, feed intake decreases, and vice versa. 
                Environmental temperatures also play an important role in determining how much feed a flock will consume.

        <p>
            Just sitting with your chickens can be a stress relief in itself. Watching them running round like miniature dinosaurs, chasing the same bits of food, coming to sit with you and have a chat...
            And there are other behaviours our chickens instinctively do which are essential for their welfare and which we would do well to copy, to help calm our own feelings of stress and anxiety.
            So if you feel like stress is making you sick, or you just need a bit of light relief - read on!
            And if you'd like to share your own story about how your chickens relieve stress and give you joy, you can do it by clicking right here!
            Take time for yourself each day. Chickens are social beings but even so, hens take time for themselves every day.
            It's called egg-laying. During that time, they remove themselves away to somewhere they feel safe - hopefully your nest boxes. They prefer that the nesting area is a private, quiet, somewhat dark place where they can rest and relax.
            If you've ever seen a hen in the laying zone, she'll often seem almost Zen-like in her relaxed state. 
            The relaxing part of this is so important to the successful, stress-free lay that many people (including me!) add a herb mix to the bedding. Lavender is a good choice.
