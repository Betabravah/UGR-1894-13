        <h1>Carbon Emission</h1>
        <p>Human activities, including modern agriculture, contribute to greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions (IPCC, 1996). 
            Agriculture has been reported to be responsible for 6.3% of the GHG emissions in the U.S.
            , of this 53.5% were a result of animal agriculture. Of the emissions from animal agriculture, poultry was 
            responsible for only 0.6%. Much of the CO2e that is generated from the poultry industry is primarily from feed
             production, the utilization of fossil fuels and manure management (Pelletier, 2008; EWG, 2011). While the poultry
              producer does not have control over the production of the feed that is used on the farm, there are other GHG emissions 
              that occur on the farm that are under their control. These emissions may be in the form of purchased electricity, propane 
            used for heating houses and incineration of dead birds, diesel used in farm equipment which includes generators and emissions 
            from manure management.</p>

        <h2>Solar Energy</h2>
        <p>Roosters are free to roam the floor of a temperature controlled rearing shed, powered by solar energy.
            The chickens are raised in a temperature-controlled atmosphere of between 23°C and 24°C in winter, rising to a maximum of 26°C in summer.
            The new farm – known as Granja Finet – complements two others owned by Josep Carrera located at Els Alamún and Vila-sana. This latest investment increases 
            his stock holding to over 130,000 birds – but this is his first venture into solar-powered off-grid farming. 
            Solar energy is a promising technology that could improve sustainability and reduce production costs, but poultry producers must first determine if the 
            benefits outweigh the initial investment required.

        <h2>Water FootPrint</h2>
        <p> The water footprint (WF) is a comprehensive indicator of freshwater resource appropriation, alongside the traditional and restricted measure of water 
            withdrawal, which was introduced by Hoekstra and Hung. WF assessment was developed by the Water Footprint Network (WFN), and accounts for the green water 
            (the volume of rainwater), blue water (surface and groundwater) and grey water (the volume of freshwater that is required to assimilate the load of pollutants) 
            footprint; assessment of the sustainability of the WF and identifying response strategies.
            Much research in recent years has focused on the WF of animal products due to water assessment of the value chain of animal production, which concentrates on water saving. 
            The high grey WF in swine production leads to environmental pollution, and in terms of dairy cows and sheep, changing the composition of feed and shifting the production 
            system can reduce the water footprint. It has become clear that livestock and poultry products significantly contribute to water degradation and water scarcity.</p>
